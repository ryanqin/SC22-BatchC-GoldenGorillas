# Cointage
## An A.I. change counting program and currency converter

### How to use
Simply go to our website and upload an image of coins. Please make sure that this image is as high quality as possible as it helps the A.I. make better judgements. Try to take a photo facing directly down on coins to make the A.I.'s job a little easier. Please take a photo with as much lighting as possible, but don't overdo it. Our supported file formats are png, jpeg, jpg, and heic, so consider this when taking your photo. Our A.I. will detect the coins present in the image, count up the total they represent, and convert the total to a currency of your choosing

### Our Vision
We made this program to bring coinage back into the economy and to make cashiers' lives a bit easier. Coins have been losing prominence in the recent past and have slowly started to fall into obscurity in favor of credit and dollar bills. People who have coins never think to use them, instead putting them in jars where they are practically dead to the person and the economy. We seek to help coins gain prominence again by making the handling of coinage easier for all.
